# Digital Ocean and Docker

How to set use docker and docker machine with digital ocean and deploy a service 

## A short introduction

Recently I started to get interested into [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), the software container platform. 

Now after a few months i decided that it could have been funny to use docker again in order to deploy my personal web site [niclan.io](niclan.io) in order to take full control of the stack from setting up the machine till the deploy and the hosting of the service.

In order to do that i decided to go for [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) because it provides some support for docker and docker-machine. 

A valid alternative to digital ocean that I already had the chance to try are [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/it/) and in particular its [EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/it/ecs/) container service.
  
 So here below the process i followed:
 
 ## Requirements
 
 You need to sign up with digital ocean and to have docker and docker machine installed.
 
 ## Setting up the droplet
 
 Basically the main resource I used to set up the droplet and the container is this [article](https://docs.docker.com/machine/examples/ocean/#step-4-run-docker-commands-on-the-droplet).
 
 After signing up and getting my personal token I created my very first droplet.
 
```
$ docker-machine create --driver digitalocean --digitalocean-access-token xxxxx docker-sandbox nic-lan-web
